	/**
	 * Discussion about Singly Linked List
	 * 
	 *  What is a Linked List?
	 *  
	 *  	Sequential list of nodes holds data.
	 *  	Last node has null always
	 *  
	 *  Where are Linked List used?
	 *  	
	 *  	Used in Many Lists, Queue, Stack
	 *  	Great for Circular Linked List
	 *  	Model real world objects such as trains
	 *  	
	 *  Terminology
	 *  	Head Reference
	 *  	Tail Reference
	 *  
	 *  Singly List vs Doubly Linked List
	 *  	Singly Linked
	 *  		Contains next only forward direction.
	 *  		Adv: Uses less memory
	 *  		Dis-Adv: Can't access the backward nodes
	 *  	Doubly Linked
	 *  		Contains both backward and forward.
	 *  		Adv: Can access both direction, O(1) delete
	 *  		Dis-Adv: More memory 
	 * Implementation Details
	 * 
	 *  How to insert new elements?
	 *  	Singly Linked List
	 *  	Doubly Linked List
	 *  How to remove elements?
	 *  	Singly Linked List
	 *  	Doubly Linked List
	 * Complexity Analysis
	 * 		Singly Linked List
	 * 		Doubly Linked List
	 * 
	 * Code Implementation (Doubly Linked List)
